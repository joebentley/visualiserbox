* TODO Add audio
* TODO Parallelise pixel calculation or use GPU
Should be easy to parallelise since the state is totally independent
for each pixel, however this is really what the GPU is for. Using the
GPU will add a huge amount of complexity though.
* TODO Add help screen for basic info and keyboard shortcuts
* TODO Parallelise video rendering
When moving to using the pipe, all parallelisation was removed.
* TODO Better error handling
In few places, there are a lot of unwraps, such as in the
save_as_video function. Should consider using the anyhow crate

This is difficult in the save_as_video function as it is totally
asynchronous, it just launches a thread.
* DONE Allow resetting time
This would be useful for resetting the state of the VM since the
calculations are based on absolute time
* DONE Add shortcut to delete the whole input buffer
* DONE Try using pipe instead of files for ffmpeg
Saving the image frames as pngs takes too long. We can try pipeing the
images from memory to the ffmpeg stdin 
* DONE Add .toml based configuration
How many frames the recording buffer remembers
Whether to show fps (could also be a keyboard shortcut)
* DONE Add assertions to ensure state is valid in ScreenRecorderState
* DONE Look for first free filename for video
Currently just overwrites the current one
* DONE Figure out why the output video seems slower than the FPS
