* TODO Allow pausing animation
* TODO Add sequencing between programs
- Fade?
- Each line should be a program
- Marker going down left side of lines depending on which program is
  currently enabled
* TODO Add file dialog for saving video
* TODO Parallelise pixel calculation or use GPU
Should be easy to parallelise since the state is totally independent
for each pixel, however this is really what the GPU is for. Using the
GPU will add a huge amount of complexity though.
* TODO Add help screen for basic info and keyboard shortcuts
* TODO Parallelise video rendering
When moving to using the pipe, all parallelisation was removed.
* TODO Error handling in video saving
This is difficult as it is totally asynchronous, it just launches a
thread.
* TODO Add keyboard shortcut that duplicates a line to the next line
* TODO Allow pushing audio loop back onto stack on macOS
* TODO Build .app bundle on macOS
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1596945/building-osx-app-bundle
* TODO Add undo/redo functionality
* DONE Allow saving programs
* DONE Fix colours in release mode
* DONE Random program commands
- Random program (C-r)
- Rotate program left/right
* DONE Add proper text editing
* DONE Remove image dependency
Since we aren't saving as a PNG on disc anymore, we really don't need
this dependency, and it's quite a big one, especially with the default
features enabled.
* DONE Add audio
* DONE Better error handling
In few places, there are a lot of unwraps, such as in the
save_as_video function. Should consider using the anyhow crate.
* DONE Allow resetting time
This would be useful for resetting the state of the VM since the
calculations are based on absolute time
* DONE Add shortcut to delete the whole input buffer
* DONE Try using pipe instead of files for ffmpeg
Saving the image frames as pngs takes too long. We can try pipeing the
images from memory to the ffmpeg stdin 
* DONE Add .toml based configuration
How many frames the recording buffer remembers
Whether to show fps (could also be a keyboard shortcut)
* DONE Add assertions to ensure state is valid in ScreenRecorderState
* DONE Look for first free filename for video
Currently just overwrites the current one
* DONE Figure out why the output video seems slower than the FPS
