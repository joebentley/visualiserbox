* TODO Add .toml based configuration
How many frames the recording buffer remembers
Whether to show fps (could also be a keyboard shortcut)
* TODO Allow resetting time
This would be useful for resetting the state of the VM since the
calculations are based on absolute time
* TODO Add shortcut to delete the whole input buffer
* TODO Add help screen for basic info and keyboard shortcuts
* TODO Better error handling
In few places, there are a lot of unwraps, such as in the
save_as_video function. Should consider using the anyhow crate
* TODO Add assertions to ensure state is valid in ScreenRecorderState
* DONE Look for first free filename for video
Currently just overwrites the current one
* DONE Figure out why the output video seems slower than the FPS
